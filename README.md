### Long-read Isoform Annotation Pipeline

This Snakemake pipeline processes long-read CaptureSeq data from raw basecalled FASTQs through isoform detection, read collapsing, and quality control. 

The pipeline uses a `samples.tsv` to control sample-specific input paths.

### ðŸ›  Tool Dependencies and Versions

This pipeline relies on pre-installed tools on the Earlham Institute cluster. Tools are sourced at the start of each batch job using `source package` or module-style commands.

### Environment Setup

I source my `~/.bashrc` which has conda, so you will need an env with pandas installed
